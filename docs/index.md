# Welcome to My Product Docs

This site is generated from Markdown using **MkDocs Material** and published via **GitHub Pages**.

## What you’ll find here

- **Guides** for installation, configuration, and troubleshooting
- **Standards** that keep documentation consistent (style, terminology, review)
- **Downloads** for PDF and Word exports (generated during publish)

## How changes are handled

All documentation updates follow a **Docs-as-Code workflow**:

1. Create a branch and update Markdown files.
2. Open a Pull Request (PR).
3. Automated checks run:
   - Style lint (Vale)
   - Build validation (MkDocs)
   - AI review (Deviation Alert report)
4. A human reviewer approves or requests changes.
5. After approval, the PR is merged and the site is published.

> Tip: Keep topics short and task-focused. Use headings so readers can scan quickly.
